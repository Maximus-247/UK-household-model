# UK Household Size Prediction Model

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing household sizes in the UK based on various socio-economic and demographic factors. The study aims to classify households into small (less than 3 members) and large (3 or more members) groups using machine learning models. The best-performing model is selected for future predictions.

## Problem Statement

Household size is influenced by numerous factors such as age, marriage duration, literacy, number of children, stage of life, and income levels. Understanding these factors is critical for policy-making and planning social services. This study explores these determinants and develops a predictive model to classify UK households.

## Objectives

1. Analyze the dataset to uncover key factors affecting household size.

2. Build multiple predictive models to classify households as small or large.

3. Identify the model with the best accuracy for forecasting household sizes in the UK.

4. Provide actionable insights for policymakers based on the findings.

# General Analysis of Results

1. The dataset includes attributes such as age, marital status, income, employment, number of children, and household composition.

2. Models were trained to classify households using logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.

3. Feature importance analysis revealed that number of children, marital status, and employment type were significant predictors.

4. The best-performing model achieved a high accuracy score, indicating strong predictive power.

5. The confusion matrix highlighted some misclassifications, suggesting the potential for additional feature engineering.

## Conclusion

The study successfully demonstrated that machine learning models can predict UK household sizes with high accuracy. The findings highlight the significant role of socio-economic factors in household composition. Future improvements, such as integrating more granular financial data and refining classification thresholds, could enhance prediction quality.

## Recommendations

1. Leverage the model for policy planning and targeted social service interventions.

2. Expand the dataset to include more detailed financial and housing data for improved accuracy.

3. Test alternative algorithms such as deep learning to enhance predictive performance.

4. Regularly update the model with new household data to maintain accuracy over time.
